### gov_1006_replication_relief_fatigue

This is a replication project for Gov 1006 at Harvard University taught by Preceptor David Kane.

This project includes data collected from scraped from MLB Statcast from 2014-2016. 

Project seeks to answer the question of quantifying velocity loss on MLB relief pitchers based on their usage in the preceding days. The motivation for this project is the increasing importance and reliance on relievers in the MLB today. Bullpens today contain pitchers that throw high velocities and are called up to come into many different situations. The goals of the paper is to build this model as a tool for MLB managers to use to manage their relievers as an extra piece of evidence when they are deciding if they should bring a reliever in when they have pitched a lot recently and could possibly be suffering from affects of fatigue. Burris and Coleman seek to quantify fatigue and how it affects relievers subsequent velocities.
